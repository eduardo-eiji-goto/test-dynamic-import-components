# Test Dynamic Import Components

This project was a proposal for a group activity on a Lecture about Web Development and frameworks.

1. Each person would create their own component
2. They'd commit that component to their own branch
3. The branches would all be merged
4. Everyones components should appear on the page
5. The website would be published so everyone can see their own and others' creations
